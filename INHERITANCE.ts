// RULE OF THREE 

// upon seeing duplication three times, 
// we should refactor it into an abstraction.

// Wouldn’t it be nice if we could reuse code or extend it for more specific use cases? That’s what inheritance is about.

// Inheritance ensures that codes are reused. There are millions of Java and Python libraries that a programmer can use through inheritance. 
// The properties of a class can be inherited and extended by other classes or functions.
//  There are two types of classes.
//  One is the Parent or base class, and the other is the child class which can inherit the properties of the parent class. 
//  Inheritance is a major pillar in Object-Oriented programming. 
//  It is the mechanism by which classes in Java, Python, and other OOP languages inherits the attribute of other classes






// Inheritance is about code reuse, not hierarchies.
